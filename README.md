# Programming Guidelines
This project, as part of the Standard Analyses & Code Sharing working group, adheres to the same [Good Programming Practices](https://github.com/phuse-org/phuse-scripts/blob/master/whitepapers/ProgrammingGuidelines.md).

# GitHub Flavored Markdown
[GH Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) is not always intuitive, but at least it's documented :)

Special notes:
+ blank lines are highly meaningful for line wrapping
+ 2 spaces (totally invisible!) at end of line can force line breaks ... so don't accidently trim trailing spaces from any GH markdown file!
