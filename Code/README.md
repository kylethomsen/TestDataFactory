# Code snippets
Code snippets, for now, to demonstrate reading a database configuration workbook of spreadsheets that specifies a clinical database.  

Result data sets are in the Data folder, at the same level as this Code folder.  

See "[TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsx](../TrialDesign-Tool/TrialDesignMatrix_for_TDF_study.xlsx)" in the TrialDesign-Tool folder. This is the example clinical database specification workbook.
