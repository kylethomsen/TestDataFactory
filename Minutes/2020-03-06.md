Updates:

* PharmaSUG e-Poster writing
  * Regardless of attendance policy (group gatherings) prepare paper/e-Poster
  * Expect publication of proceedings, even if gathering is cancelled
  * (DD) progress report or draft by 09. Mar to team
    * https://www.pharmasug.org/us/2020/cfp.html
    * Mar 27, copyright grant form
    * Mar 27, papers due - e-Poster slide deck (from template), as well?
    * By Apr 10, REGISTER - See note: "Please wait to register for the conference until you receive an invitation email that will direct you on how to register and will automatically apply the presenters discount."

* Test/SEND Dataset Factory Project initial discussion, with follow-up pending ... 
  * Variable modeling & "Sufficiently realistic databases" are common topics and areas for collaboration
  * Eileen Ching (GSK SP Director) next steps ... Richard Marshall (sp?) is a consultant to Eileen's group
  * Once we establish "governance" for the Trial Design Matrix, we can update
    * Update to latest CDISC (consider effort/policy of VB code maintenance)
    * Versus migrating concepts to one of our existing technologies (SAS, R)

* TDF design based on initial dev efforts
  * "Realistic Data"
    * Within-variable sanity is less important - nonetheless guided by published standards (CDISC/NCI CT, MedDRA, WHO Drug)
    * Across-var, across-domain sanity/compatibility is more important - can't test software without this db integrity
    * Stated approach - 
      * We are not trying to simulate real patients, real databases
      * TDF delivers starting-point dbs, which users can customize to suit their needs for realism
  * Trial Design Matrix - SDTM_Configuration tab

* TDF development
  * Continue R implementation (PS)
  * Progress SAS creation of TD domains (post PS TD outputs & report)
  * General utilities / syntax for querying
    * set of %query_... macros, with standard return-value conventions
    *  CDISC CT values, 
    * CDISC DSet/Var attribs, 
    * TDM elements, 
    * TDF_Config elements
    * others?
  * From SEND:
    * Access latest CDISC CT from NCI: "https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CDISC/SDTM/SDTM%20Terminology.html" 
    * Lab test config file (name, nr, oru, stu, ?value distribution for realism? )


* ACTIONS:
  * Upcoming PharmaSUG 2020
    * (DD) to draft by Mon, Mar 09, for review by team
    * (DD) update e-Poster, 4-6 slides, afterwards

  * (DD) Update TDF progress slide, once above actions completed

  * SEND/Data Factory collaboration
    * (DD) Check with Standard Analysis / PhUSE WG leadership - PhUSE platform for working software
    * (PS) As R/Shiny liaison to SEND/DF group
  
  * (Team) Continue TDF dev, as feasible
    * (DD) Update some TDF documentation in GitHub for demo purposes

* To DO
  * [ ] Review, assess need for updating TDM workbook based on Pinnacle 21 findings, above (link to post)
  * [ ] Review Hanming - simplified TS for SEND tool
