  * Available to industry
  * Works with sponsor security requirements
  * Works with team & continuity requirements
* TDM / TDF approaches can proceed in parallel
  1 Alt. tech option for TDM - Progress an interface that meets PhUSE WG objectives
  2 Progress TDF SAS/R code based on reading SDTM_Configuration from Excel workbook
* (PS) to check feasibility of a short-term community version of his co.s platform, separate from commercial version

ACTIONS:

Prior topics to keep in mind:
  * Test/SEND Dataset Factory Project follow-up
  * TDF design based on initial dev efforts - achieving sufficiently "Realistic" data
