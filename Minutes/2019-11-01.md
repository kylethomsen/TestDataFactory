* Reviewed github\code structure, starting-point design
  * m_*.sas macros - eg, reading in TrialDesignMatrix metadata
  * create_<domain>.sas programs - eg, umbrella program that then generates component variables
  * generate_<detail>.sas programs - eg, that generate specific variables within the domain program
  
* Two components that TDF will not provide, but are readily available from CDISC
  * [SDTMIG variable and dataset metadata, excel](https://www.cdisc.org/members-only/cdisc-library-archives), currently v3.3
  * [SDTM Terminology metadata, excel](https://www.cdisc.org/members-only/cdisc-library-archives), currently 2019-09-03

* Next Steps
  * The team will self-assign based on their capacity:
  * Progress code development for DM domain
    * further variable definition in the TrialDesignMatrix workbook (SDTM_Configuration tab) 
    * "generate_..." macros to read, interpret, implement next vars
    * guided by "CORE" attribute in SDTMIG variable metadata
    * Note - REQ DM vars remaining: SEX, COUNTRY
    * Note - EXP DM vars are numerous: RF, RFX, RFI, RFP date/times, age, race, actual arm
  * Non-code tasks include initializing some user documentation
 
# Self-assignments:
( JD - date/time variables )
DDT - read in SDTMIG *dataset* metadata, read in SDTM terminology, update DM with country var (using those sources)
