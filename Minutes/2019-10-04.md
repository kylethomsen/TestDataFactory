1. Jessica - weight race,  
             read in CDISC SDTM IG variable attributes,  
             CDISC control terminology  
             reference start/end  

2. Dante - rely on CDISC SDTM IG variable attributes,  
           pick another (age?)  
           read in TE and TV tabs from TDM
